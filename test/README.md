# data

There are 4 EDI IPI files with consecutive dates as initial data. Note that these files contain only a small part of the real data. By importing these 4 files you will not have at your disposal the entire and up-to-date IPI database! 

If you want to add more data after the initial import is done, make sure that all further files have consecutive dates that continue the last date from initial import *without any gap*. Each day must be represented by a *single* file. And, the most important, the content of files must *strictly* implement the EDI protocol for the IPI system.
